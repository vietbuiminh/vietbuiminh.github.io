## Visitation Hours 🤗

-- For the purposes of this policy, a host is any Augustana student resident who is entertaining guests. A guest

comfortability of having someone else in the room.
-- Students can only host overnight visitors with the permission of their roommate(s). Visits are limited to 48
hours per week. If an agreement about the visit cannot be reached, the rights of the non-hosting roommate
will prevail.

three guests per visit
